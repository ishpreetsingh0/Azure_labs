Building Infrastructure with Azure Pipelines
Introduction
You have been given an ARM template for a Linux VM to deploy to Azure. Using Azure DevOps, you must check the ARM template for errors (linting), and deploy the VM to the provided Azure environment.

Solution
Log in to the Azure portal using the credentials provided on the lab instructions page.

Log in to the linVM server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Create an Azure DevOps Organization
In the main search bar, search for and select Azure DevOps organizations.

Scroll down and click My Azure DevOps Organizations.

Select your country/region from the dropdown list. Click Continue.

Select Create new organization > Continue > Continue (complete the required CAPTCHA).

Set the following values to create a project:

Project name: MyFirstProject
Visibility: Private
Click + Create project.

Push Code to Azure Repos
In the linVM virtual machine, clone the repo:
git clone -b arm https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/content-az400-lab-resources.git
Move to the content-az400-lab-resources directory:
cd content-az400-lab-resources
List the contents of the directory:
ls
List the current remote origin:
git remote -v
Remove the current remote origin:
git remote remove origin
Verify that it was removed successfully:
git remote -v
Create Personal Access Token
Go back to Azure DevOps. In the upper right-hand corner, click the User settings icon > Personal access tokens.

Click + New Token and set the following values:

Name: linuxvm
Scopes: Full access
Click Create.

Copy the linuxvm token and save it in a safe location.

Click Close.

At the top, click the Azure DevOps logo. Then, select your project.

From the left navigation menu, click Repos.

Copy the contents from Push an existing repository from command line.

Back in the Linux VM, paste the push commands. When prompted for a password, use your newly created access token.

Back in the Azure Repos tab, click refresh to see the application code.

Download Self-Hosted Agent
On the bottom left, click Project settings.

Scroll down the left-hand pane and under Pipelines, select Agent pools.

Select the Default pool.

Click New agent.

Select the Linux tab.

Click the Copy icon, next to Download to copy the agent URL to your clipboard. Paste it to a text file to use in the following steps. Keep this tab and popup open.

Go back to the Linux VM. Then, change directory to the root:

cd ~
Make and navigate to a new directory called Downloads:

mkdir Downloads && cd Downloads
Run wget against the agent URL you just copied:

wget <AGENT_URL>
Navigate back to the root (cd ~).

Create and navigate to another directory called myagent:

mkdir myagent && cd myagent
Unzip the package you just downloaded. You can copy this same command from the popup in Azure DevOps to get the full package and version number:

tar zxvf <PACKAGE>
Review the contents of the directory (ls). Observe all of the files and folders for the agent.

Configure the Agent
Run the configuration script:

./config.sh
Type y to accept the license agreement.

When prompted for your server URL, go back to Azure DevOps and grab the URL from your browser. It will look something like https://dev.azure.com/clouduser..., followed by some characters (i.e., copy everything up to and not including /MyFirstProject). Paste this in the terminal.

Press Enter to accept the default authentication type of PAT.

For personal access token, copy and paste the personal access token you created and saved earlier in this lab.

Press Enter to accept the default agent pool.

Press Enter to accept the default name.

Press Enter to accept the default work folder.

Run the agent interactively so that it is always listening for any jobs:

./run.sh
